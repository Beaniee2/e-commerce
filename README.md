### What I learned and continued development
To begin with I struggled with the basket concept and how to use JavaScript to create this, once I had done some research played around with a few concepts I began to understand how to create this with JavaScript more. I would still like to spend more time in the future to learn more about JavaScript and to understand it more. WIth moreknowledge I would like to come back to this design and add to the items as well as alter the syle of the site when more items are added.
